# Kewl Spigot
A fork of SpigotX (based on ClubSpigot)

This is a spigot built to be performant and optimized while allowing customizability over kb and smoother pots.

We currently use patches from the following spigots (authors are also listed if found):
 - MineTick (Poweruser)
 - SpigotX (Joeleoli)
 - ClubSpigot (Joeleoli, Dewgs, TehNeon, Manthe, & more)
 - PandaSpigot (A lot of people)
 - KigPaper (ProjectKig)
 - SportPaper (OCTC / Electroid)

New Features:
 - Custom KB System allowing for changing the Vertical and Horizontal friction at different values.
 - Tickloop fixes.
 - A lot of data leak fixes.
 - Customizable enchant limits.
